### Overview
What follows is an exemplary story of an Odoo implementation in just 3 days! Hard to believe right? We just did that for our internal sales team last month!  Odoo is well known in the ERP world for its really short implementation durations and flexibility to accommodate changes on the go. We wanted to share the experience of how we went about selecting Odoo from the gamut of ERP/CRM platforms available in the market today and managed to implement it within 3 business days.

### Why we needed a CRM?

This implementation story started when our sales team experienced difficulties in managing leads for one of our products ‘ReachOut’, a custom field services management platform. When we started out with ReachOut, we had about 3 or 4 signups weekly and emails were sufficient for our Sales team to handle., However, as the number of leads grew rapidly, it became increasingly difficult for the sales team to manage with only emails. To tackle these challenges, we considered the need for a proper CRM software and saw a lot of potential in Odoo due to its flexibility and short implementation durations.

### The Implementation

After the Sales team were previewed with a demo using default Odoo CRM features, they were instantly convinced that it will ease their workflow and improve productivity to a large extent.

Upon implementation, our convictions proved right as the managers were content with the way they were able to seamlessly track their team’s work.

The next step was an integration between Odoo and ReachOut, a couple of hours of development, followed by deployment, which was done on a server with specs as minimal as 2 CPU, 4GB of RAM and a one hour training for the sales team followed by UAT for a day, we were all set to start using the system!

And to add to the benefits, Odoo User documentation is available online for most of the major apps in the system which is really easy to follow and something that anyone from a non-technical background can understand.

Yes, three days is all it took to implement a CRM system for a sales team that was handling hundreds of leads per day. The fact that Odoo is very flexible and one of the most sustainable ERPs gives us more confidence about implementing other modules for various team in the organization. And as I’m writing this, we’re all set to roll out Odoo HRM in our company, but that’s another story which we will definitely touch upon another day.

### Impact of Odoo CRM

The problem we had prior to implementing Odoo CRM was that the leads had to be picked and assigned manually from the emails that came in. The follow-up process was really difficult to manage since it was not so organized, and there was a lot of effort being wasted in maintaining excel sheets to track the leads.

Enter Odoo, and the assigning process is totally automated. Follow-ups became more organized, and the managers are getting really good insights into the activities of the team members. The status of every lead that each member is working on has become more transparent, and the management team feels that Odoo CRM will definitely improve the sales numbers as the processes are getting streamlined.

### Why should you consider Odoo CRM for your organization?

The amount of consumer data generated for business owners is increasing on an hourly basis. Without the proper tools to handle all these customer information, decision making, forecasting, purchase and sales processes have become a great chaos in terms of efficiency.

The Odoo CRM deals with aspects of the business like:

1. Sales tracking
2. Prospecting
3. Recording customer interactions
4. Pipeline management
5. Evaluating marketing campaigns

Since satisfied customers are your most valuable asset, imagine what a unified system that includes major business apps and a VOIP system would do for your business.

A system like Odoo which has capabilities of adapting to the growth of your company is something that every organization that needs a CRM should consider. And people often make the mistake of choosing big names in the CRM arena, whereas something more flexible and integrated with other business apps that can be deployed as the company grows is a much better choice any day for an SME.

We can definitely go on and on about the advantages of Odoo CRM, but considering that your time is precious, all we can say is that this exercise showed us how even a small sales team can use Odoo for the benefit of their customers. We hope this story may help other growing SAAS companies save time, improve visibility and manage customer relationships using Odoo.
